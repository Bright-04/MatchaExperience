# üçµ Matcha Hood - How We Built This Website

## What Is This Website?

Matcha Hood is an educational website about matcha green tea with a Vietnamese perspective. We created it to share information about matcha's history, types, and benefits in an easy-to-navigate format.

## How We Built It

### Tools We Used
- **Visual Studio Code**: The software we used to write all the code
- **GitHub**: Where we stored our work and collaborated with team members
- **Vercel**: The service that makes the website available online to everyone

### Building Blocks
- **HTML**: Creates the structure and content of the website
- **CSS**: Makes everything look nice with colors, layouts, and visual effects
- **JavaScript**: Adds interactive elements and animations to make the site engaging

## Website Features

### Visual Elements
- **Custom Graphics**: Specially designed illustrations and images for the project
- **Beautiful Fonts**: Selected typography that's easy to read and visually appealing
- **Icons**: Small visual symbols that help guide visitors through the site

### User Experience
- **Smooth Animations**: Gentle movements and transitions to enhance the browsing experience
- **Fast Loading**: We optimized everything to make pages load quickly
- **Easy Navigation**: Simple menus and clear structure to help visitors find information

## How We Organized Our Work

We kept everything neatly organized by:
- Separating content, design, and interactive elements
- Grouping images and resources by which section they belong to
- Using clear naming conventions to keep track of everything

## Making The Website Available Online

### Our Process
1. We created and tested the website locally (on our computers)
2. We uploaded our work to GitHub to save and share it
3. We connected GitHub to Vercel to automatically publish the website
4. When we make updates, the changes appear on the live site almost immediately

### Making It Fast and Reliable
- Images load only when needed to save data and speed up the site
- Important content loads first so you can start reading right away
- The website works equally well on all modern web browsers
