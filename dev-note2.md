# Code Review: Potential Issues

I've analyzed your code and found a few potential issues that could cause problems:

## HTML Structure Issues

1. **Extra closing tag**: Line 82 starts with `</section>` without a corresponding opening tag:
   ```html
   </section>			<section id="history" class="history">
   ```
   This could cause unexpected layout issues.

2. **Inconsistent indentation**: Some sections have varying indentation levels which makes the code harder to maintain.

## Navigation Problems

1. **Links to disabled sections**: Your navigation includes links to sections that are commented out:
   ```html
   <!-- Temporarily disabled navigation links
   <li><a href="#about" class="nav-link">Giới Thiệu</a></li>
   -->
   ```
   Users clicking these links in the commented-out navigation items won't be taken anywhere.

## JavaScript Conflicts

1. **Missing DOM elements**: Your `initRevealClasses()` function tries to access elements that are commented out:
   ```js
   document.querySelector(".about-image").classList.add("reveal", "reveal-left");
   document.querySelector(".about-text").classList.add("reveal", "reveal-right");
   ```
   This will cause JavaScript errors since these elements don't exist in the DOM.

2. **Testimonial functionality**: Code for testimonial sliders will try to run even though the testimonials section is commented out.

## Responsive Design Concerns

1. **Fixed iframe dimensions**: The YouTube iframe in the hero section has fixed dimensions (471x838) which might not scale well on all devices.

## Recommended Fixes

1. Remove the extra `</section>` tag at line 82
2. Either enable the commented-out sections or remove their corresponding JavaScript functionality
3. Update the navigation to only show links to active sections
4. Make the YouTube iframe responsive with percentage-based width or CSS media queries
